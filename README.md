# Expansion-testcases
The following repository contains supplementary material for [1] including scripts using KNITRO [2] and Gurobi [3] to perform expansion as well as data for two cases of expansion. The two cases for expansion that are considered are:
1) Reconstruction of a 14 bus testcase in which each transmission line and generator is considered for expansion. This testcase is labeled "case_14_expansion.m"
2) Expansion of a synthetic Eastern Interconnection modified from [4] that decommissions certain generators as well as increases the loading factor in a certain area. This testcase is labeled, "ACTIVSg70k_expansion.raw"

The repository contains two scripts to consider the expansion of the 14 bus testcase. The first script, labeled "14_bus_expansion_knitro.m" considers AC constraints using KNITRO while looking at the expansion and operation of the 14 bus testcase. The second script, labeled "14_bus_expanussion_gurobi.m" considers DC constraints using Gurobi. Both of these scripts are run using Matlab.
